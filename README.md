## OnlineMovieStore-DBMS

By: Jonathan Ma, Julian Kuyumcu, Chun Yiu Cheung

This repository includes the Python GUI and Shell Files for our Online Movie Database System.

This DBMS application contains a main menu where the users can press buttons to perform operations on the database. Additionally, there is a separate menu for query operations where users can run specific queries or their own custom queries using Oracle SQL commands. The user can also exit the application by closing the window.


In order to run this application, the following steps must be done on a Windows Operating System:
  - Download and install Python
  - Run 'pip install tk' and 'pip install cx_oracle' in the terminal
  - Download Oracle Instant Client v21.7 from https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/database/technologies/instant-client.html
  - Run main.py
